### TODO APP - tRPC

The aim is to create a simple TODO app have client and server side with tRPC.
For this we are keeping the server and client in the same repo without using mono repo 


### server

- exposed RPC APIs
    - CreateTodo
    - 

Run the client 
- compile code : `tsc -b`
- start server : `node dist/server/index.js`

### client 
client is demoed as simple node app. But the implementation is similar in any other client like React, NextJs etc.

To Run 
- compile code : `tsc -b`
- start server : `node dist/server/index.js`
